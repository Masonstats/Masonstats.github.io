## Getting started

I am a biostatistician working for an international biopharmaceutical R&D company. My main work is clinical trial design, statistical analysis and real-world drug cost-effectiveness analysis. I have a double masterâ€™s degree in Applied Statistics and Econometrics. My areas of interest include drug clinical trials, health economics, Bayesian statistics and modeling, R and Python.

We work extensively with pharmaceutical technology companies, CROs and pharmaceutical companies to conduct drug clinical trials and real-world data exploration. We now have ongoing clinical programs covering a variety of diseases including breast cancer, lung cancer and diabetes. If you are interested in participating in our project, please contact me.
